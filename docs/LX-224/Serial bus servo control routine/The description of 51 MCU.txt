In the example, all 51 routines are based on the STC12C5A60S2, and are tested with the 11.0592MHz external crystal under STC12C5A60S2
In the example, all 51 routines are tested under the STC15W4K16S4 by modifying the hardware-related code such as serial port initialization and using the internal clock at 22.1184MHz
The STC89C52RC test failed.The STC89C52RC serial port cannot generate a baud rate of 11520 under the 11.0592MHz clock.It requires a crystal oscillator of 22.1184 and has not been further tested.
